# Approach Used 

The project began with basic data analysis, starting with unnesting the relevant columns using the explode function. I handled missing values separately for categorical and numerical variables. For categorical variables, I calculated their frequency distribution using both graphical and non-graphical methods.

I identified key trends such as the top 10 countries producing the highest number of TV movies and TV shows. Additionally, I analyzed the best weeks or months to launch TV shows and movies to maximize engagement. I performed a detailed analysis of actors and directors involved in different types of TV shows and movies. Furthermore, I examined the most popular movie genres based on their performance.

These insights provide actionable recommendations that could assist Netflix in optimizing content release strategies and ultimately driving revenue growth.
